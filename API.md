# Vertex API

Despite the fact that ChatÂ² is intended to have a graphical frontend,
the `vertex` client itself is actually a simple HTTP REST server that
can be queried for messages from other users, and that messages can be
sent to. This architecture is intended to provide maximum flexibility
for writing frontends in any programming language that can run on any
system.
